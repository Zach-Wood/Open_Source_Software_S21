Comparing Results:
Contributors: It seems the data on github is limited to the past year. On github itself i found 13 contributors but on the gitstats report i found 22 contributors. 

Lines of Code: On github the lines of code read as 301,774. And comparing to gitlabs i found 287,391 lines of code. 

First Commit: On github the first commit seemed to be Sunday February 16th 2020. And comparing to the gitstats results the first commit is listed as 01/2020. I am going to assume all of the data displayed under the insights tab is from the past 365 days. 

Latest Commit: On github the latest commit is Thursday November 26th, where as the gitstats results show the report generated only to December 4th 2020. 

Current Branches: Zero branches are shown under github, and nothing is shown regarding the branches on the gitstats report.
