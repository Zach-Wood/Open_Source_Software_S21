####  2. Read Four Criteria of Free Software



####  3. Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
* Choosing a licence allows you to choose what can be done with the software you write. A software license will tell others what can and canno't be done with the    source code. Not choosing a license at all will leave your source code defaulted to generic copyright protections. 
    
    
####  4. Why is it important that you SHOULDNT use a project that doesnt have an explicit license?
* Projects that do not have explicit licenses can be problematic for various reasons. The first is that you do not know where the project originated, it could be that someone forked a repository with associated licenses and is claiming it as their own. This could lead to trouble down the road. Also, since their was no explicit license the source code you use is not open source and protected by generical copyright protections. 
    
    
    
####  5. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of WHY the Web beat Gopher.
* Christopher Lee provided complelling arguments regarding the demise of Gopher from a technological perspective and also from a sociological perspective, specifically Christophers "mind share" terminology. I would have to agree with the overall consensus that Gopher was left behind due to the lack of certain neccessary teachnological features such as the lack of hyperlink support, and probably the biggest contributor would come from the mind share aspect. It is quite normal for a superior product to go un-noticed when another lesser product takes the spot light due to sociological influences such as marketing. 
    
    
    
####  6. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?
*  Looking at Linux and the GPL v2 licence ( GNU General Public License, version 2 ) in particular we can observe how the history, goals, an philosophy of the project evolved to utilize the GPL v2 license. Observing the history of linux we can see it has always been open source and always will be. The goals and philopshy of linux are one in the same, and that is allowing the users full control of the source code. The following two quotes help quantify what the linux operating system embodies. "An operating system, by its nature, embodies the philosophy of its creators... The creators of the Unix operating system started with a radical concept: they assumed that the user of their operating system would be computer literate from the start. The entire Unix philosophy revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing." AND "Linux treats everyone equally and allows everyone the maximum amount of power. That is egalitarian. Other operating systems are elitist and exclusive because they withhold or hide their power behind an inflexible Graphical User Interface that allows one to do only what the developers think we should be allowed to do." With the foundations of Linux covered, we can see it was an easy choice to use the GPL v2 license. As this license allows the users full control of the source code, and are allowed to do what they please, as long as this meets the GPL v2 license criteria.
